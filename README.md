This MATLAB file implements the distance correlation metric, where I introduced it as a multiplex functional connectivity metric
that quantifies the multiplex coupling strength between a pair of frequency-dependent time series that correspond to the
brain activity of two brain areas (ROIs).

I first applied this multiplex index in an intervention study analyzing resting-state fMRI [1].
Another study focusing on the analysis of EEG signals on both sensor, and source level will
be added here soon [2].
